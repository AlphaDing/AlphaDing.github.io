			<div class="introduction"><span>
		Welcome to my website! I am a second-year Master student at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. I graduated
  from Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology in 2015 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science. After my graduation,
  I worked at Amazon as a Software Engineer on various successful products including Alexa and Amazon Fresh. Curiosity and
  the thirst to dive deep guided me to graduate school in Computer Science.

	<br><span>
		<b> Interests: </b> My interest lies in the intersection of Machine Learning, Game Theory, and Mechanism Design.
  I like to ask the question, what makes the society it is today and how can we make it better. How to quantify “fairness” and
  design frameworks and algorithms that account for this “fairness”.  In the world where everything becomes to connect to the
  internet, how can we design systems and artificial agents which act in the best interest of human and make people better off.

			<span class="project_description">
				The hashtag #BlackLivesMatter has become a symbol of the anti-police brutality and anti-racism against the Black American movement on Twitter. The work reported in this paper aims to characterize the dynamic developments of the #BlackLivesMatter hashtag and its counter creation #AllLivesMatter on Twitter from 2014 to 2018, by utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. <br> I am very grateful to be advised by Prof. Brendan O’Connor on this project.

			<span class="project_description">
				This project is done while I was an Applied Scientist Intern at Amazon. Alexa is the voice-controlled smart assistant developed by Amazon. The Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system for Alexa already achieves high accuracy. However, it suffers from long-tail errors such as new comments or long sentences. Thus, we want to develop a model that can automatically detect and correct possible transcription errors made by upstream ASR systems. During my internship, I developed a transformer-based deep neural network model that improved word error rate (WER) by 3.5% compared to the current Alexa production model.

	<h4>More About Me</h4><span>
		<p>More personal interests: cooking food from different cultures and countries. Some dishes I have cooked includes:
  America:
  Peru:
  Iran:
  Midterrinian:
  India:
  Thai:
  Korea:
  picking out fresh ingredients. To me, cooking with a full  heart is like creating art.
  <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/h7TKZPd2ApEohhPf6">I document my favourite dishes I cooked</a></p>

<p>I grew up playing piano and attending drawing classes, both I still love to do.
  Recently, I have been induging myself in the rap world. I love the peotism of the rap lyrics, and the love and hope behind them.</p>
